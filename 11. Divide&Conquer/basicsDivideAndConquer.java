        A Divide and Conquer algorithm is a powerful problem-solving strategy
        that breaks a large, complex problem into smaller, similar subproblems, 
        solves them recursively (or iteratively) until they are trivial to solve,
        and then combines their solutions to get the final answer for the original
        problem.
        
        The following three main steps: 
        1. Divide
        2. Conquer 
        3. Combine.
